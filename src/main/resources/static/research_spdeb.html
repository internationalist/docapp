		    <p style="text-align: left;">My primary research interest is to reveal
		      targetable susceptibilities of proliferating cancer cells during
		      oncogenesis. Despite modern treatment and prevention approaches, the
		      American Cancer Society lists death due to lung cancer to be most
		      frequent, suggesting extremely poor efficacy of current lung cancer
		      treatment. At present, my laboratory is investigating the “Achilles heel”
		      of cancer cells, targeting at which would destroy cancer cells overcoming
		      their apparently robust ability to grow. Following are our ongoing lines
		      of investigation</p>
		    <h4>Project 1</h4>
		    <p>Oncogenic p53 mutations, termed as Gain of Function (GOF) mutations of
		      tumor suppressor p53, is very frequent (up to 70-95%) in all types of
		      human lung cancers, which show accelerated growth, metastasis,
		      invasiveness, and resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. The mutant p53
		      proteins have abnormally long half-life. Our published studies have
		      demonstrated that tumors with GOF p53 develop dependency on the GOF p53
		      mutants for their maintenance and progression. Accordingly, elimination or
		      depletion of endogenous GOF p53 mutants drastically reduces the
		      tumorigenic phenotype of many human lung cancer cell lines.</p>
		    <img class="img-thumbnail textwrap" alt="" src="images/spdebproject_1.png">
		    <p><strong>In a published study highlighted by the Journal of Clinical Investigation</strong>
		      (3) we demonstrated that GOF p53 activates expression of factors required
		      for DNA replication origin firing and intra-S-phase checkpoint signaling.
		      We also established that the GOF p53-dependency of tumor growth lies on
		      the ability of GOF p53 to initiate and foster inappropriate DNA
		      replication forks and thus accelerates error-prone genome duplication and
		      cell proliferation. Our unpublished studies show that increase in the
		      frequency of replication forks by GOF p53 generates replication stress,
		      and infrequent DNA strand breakage. Although infrequent, GOF p53-induced
		      fork breakage activates ATM/Chk2 signaling re-enforcing stability of GOF
		      p53 and thus establishing a feedback loop. Fork breakage also increases
		      frequency of multipolar mitotic spindle and error prone genome segregation
		      leading to cytokinetic delay and whole genome doubling reported to confer
		      selective advantage to cancer cells.</p>
		    <p><br>
		    </p>
		    <p> Our observation identifies the mechanism of GOF p53 dependency that can
		      now be therapeutically targeted at multiple levels as shown in the scheme
		      above. Targeting GOF p53 dependency should also preferentially eliminate
		      proliferating cancer cells in lung, where normal cells do not proliferate.
		      We are in the process of testing this hypothesis. </p>
		    <h4>Project 2</h4>
		    <p> Amplification and overexpression of the human homologue of mouse double
		      minute 2 (mdm2) gene is frequent in many cancers particularly in lung
		      cancer. Although interaction of MDM2 protein with the tumor suppressor p53
		      is thought to induce proliferation of cancer cells, overexpression of MDM2
		      has often been detected in lung cancer cells with wild-type or mutated
		      p53. However, the consequence of MDM2 overexpression in normal adult lung
		      has not been investigated. We have generated inducible mouse models
		      targeting human MDM2 expression in bronchiolar or alveolar cells of lung.
		      We recently reported a p53-independent cell proliferative effect of MDM2
		      specifically in lung progenitor cells only after lung injury. Our study
		      found that MDM2 is indispensable for DNA replication in progenitor cells
		      and their epithelial mesenchymal transition during epithelial repair after
		      lung injury while its overexpression robustly accelerates these
		      activities. </p>
		      <img class="img-thumbnail" alt="" src="images/spdebproject_2.png">
		      <p><br/></p>
		      <p>Since our study detected a cooperation between lung injury and oncoprotein MDM2 in progenitor cell proliferation,
		       we plan to investigate whether MDM2 overexpression may deregulate progenitor cell proliferation causing fibrosis,
		        tumor formation and/or other defects in epithelial repair and whether p53-independent DNA replication function
		         of MDM2 can be controlled to prevent these defects
